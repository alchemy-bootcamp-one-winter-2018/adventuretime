# Grading Notes

General
- Everything came together so nicely! The stories were intriguing, and the ending details in the leaderboard is a nice touch.

CSS
- There are some minor spacing and naming issues sprinkled throughout. See files for notes!
- Also, there are a few places where blocks are almost identical. Start getting in the habit of looking for repetition and questioning how we can make things DRY. Across all the code you write, not just CSS.
